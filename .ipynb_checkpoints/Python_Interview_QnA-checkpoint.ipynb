    "    - Whenever an object is created, the underlying C object has both a Python type (such as list, dict, or function) and a reference count.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **2. Generational garbage collection**\n",

    "In additional to reference counting strategy for memory management, Python also uses a method called a generational garbage collector. It is useful for garbage collection when **reference cycle** exists.\n",

    "   - Generation: The garbage collector is keeping track of all objects in memory. A new object starts its life in the first generation of the garbage collector. If Python executes a garbage collection process on a generation and object survives, it moves up into a second older genration. The Python garvage collector has three generations in total, and an object moves into an older genration whenever it survives a garbage collection process on its current generation.\n",
    "   - Threshold: For each generation, the garbage collector module has a threshold number of objects. If the number of objects exceeds that threshold, the garbage collector will trigger a collection process. For any objects that survive that process, they are moved into an older generation.\n",

    "- If an object has no outside references (only cyclic reference) add it to the discard list.\n",
    "- When the cycle is done, free up the objects on the discard list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Unlike the reference counting mechanism, you may change the behaviour of the enerational gabage collector in your Python program.** This includes changing the thresholds for triggering a garbage collection process in your code, manually triggering a garbage collection process, or disabling the garbage collection process.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Python is an **interpreted** language. That means that, unline languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript.\n",
    "- Python is **dynamically typed**, this means that you don't need to state the types of variables when you declare them.\n",
    "- Python is well suited to **object oriented programming** in that it allows the definiton of classes along with composition and inheritence. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++'s private, public)\n",
    "- In Python, **functions** are first class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects.\n",
    "- **Running** Python code is slower than compiled languages. Fortunately, Python allows the inclusion of C-based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are.\n",
    "    - The numpy package is a good example of this, it is really quite quick because a lot of the number-crunching it does isn't actually done by Python."

You can think of a namespace as a dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the values are the objects themselves. Each key-value pair maps a name to its corresponding object.\n",

    "1. **Built-in**: It contains the names of all of Python's built-in objects. These are available at all times when Python is running.\n",
    "2. **Global namespace**: It contains any names defined at the level of the main program. Python creates the global namespace when the main program body starts, and it remains in existence until the interpreter terminates.\n",
    "3. **Local namespace**: This namespace includes local names inside a function. This namespace is created when a function is **called**, and it only lasts until the function returns.\n",
